**Question:** What are two viable large-scale energy storage technologies?

**Golden Answer:** Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) and Compressed Air Energy storage (CAES)

**Context:**
- *Passage 1:* Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES) are two viable large-scale energy storage technologies for mitigating the intermittency of wind and solar power. Therefore, it is meaningful to compare the properties of hydrogen and air with typical thermodynamic storage processes. This study employs a multi-physical coupling model to compare the operations of CAES and UHS, integrating gas thermodynamics within caverns, thermal conduction, and mechanical deformation around rock caverns. Gas thermodynamic responses are validated using additional simulations and the field test data. Temperature and pressure variations of air and hydrogen within rock caverns exhibit similarities under both adiabatic and diabatic simulation modes. Hydrogen reaches higher temperature and pressure following gas charging stage compared to air, and the ideal gas assumption may lead to overestimation of gas temperature and pressure. Unlike steel lining of CAES, the sealing layer (fibre-reinforced plastic FRP) in UHS is prone to deformation but can effectively mitigates stress in the sealing layer. In CAES, the first principal stress on the surface of the sealing layer and concrete lining is tensile stress, whereas UHS exhibits compressive stress in the same areas. Our present research can provide references for the selection of energy storage methods.

- *Passage 2:* Intensive increases in electrical energy storage are being driven by electric vehicles (EVs), smart grids, intermittent renewable energy, and decarbonization of the energy economy. Advanced lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising candidates, especially for EVs and grid-scale energy storage applications. In this topical review, the recent progress and perspectives of practical LSBs are reviewed and discussed; the challenges and solutions for these LSBs are analyzed and proposed for future practical and large-scale energy storage applications. Major challenges for the shuttle effect, reaction kinetics, and anodes are specifically addressed, and solutions are provided on the basis of recent progress in electrodes, electrolytes, binders, interlayers, conductivity, electrocatalysis, artificial SEI layers, etc. The characterization strategies (including in situ ones) and practical parameters (e.g., cost-effectiveness, battery management/modeling, environmental adaptability) are assessed for crucial automotive/stationary large-scale energy storage applications (i.e., EVs and grid energy storage). This topical review will give insights into the future development of promising Li–S batteries toward practical applications, including EVs and grid storage.

- *Passage 3:* To support increasing renewable capacity for a net-zero future, energy storage will play a key role in maintaining grid stability. In this paper, all current and near-future energy storage technologies are compared for three different scenarios: (1) fixed electricity buy-in price, (2) market-based electricity buy-in price, and (3) energy storage integrated into a fully renewable electricity system. In the first part of this study, an algorithm is devised to simulate strategic buy-in of electricity for energy storage. This analysis yields a qualitative decision-making tool for a given energy storage duration and size. Building upon the first part’s findings, an integration study gives insight into expected power prices and expected storage size in a typical northwestern European fully renewable energy system. The integration study shows significant need for electricity storage with durations spanning from one to several days, typically around 40 h. Pumped Hydro Storage and Pumped Thermal storage surface as the best options. The overall levelized costs of storage are expected to be in the USD 200–500/MWh range. Integration of storage with renewables can yield a system-levelized cost of electricity of about USD 150/MWh. Allowing flexibility in demand may lower the overall system-levelized cost of electricity to USD 100/MWh. Climate change mitigation requires the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Recent plans indicate an eight-fold increase in CCS capacity by 2030, yet the feasibility of CCS expansion is debated. Using historical growth of CCS and other policy-driven technologies, we show that if plans double between 2023 and 2025 and their failure rates decrease by half, CCS could reach 0.37 GtCO.

- *Passage 4:* With the escalating utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources, demand for durable and powerful energy storage systems has increased to secure stable electricity supply. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have received ever-increasing attention as promising energy storage technologies for grid applications. However, their broad market penetration is still obstructed by many challenges, such as high capital cost and inferior long-term stability. In this work, combining the merits of both all-vanadium and iron-chromium RFB systems, a vanadium-chromium RFB (V/Cr RFB) is designed and fabricated. This proposed system possesses a high theoretical voltage of 1.41 V while achieving cost effectiveness by using cheap chromium as one of the reactive species. Experimentally, the system attains a peak power density of over 900 mW cm-2 at 50°C and demonstrates stable performance for 50 cycles with an energy efficiency of over 87%, presenting this system as a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage.

- *Passage 100:* Two large-scale energy storage technologies with limited environmental sustainability: Lead-acid batteries, which are known for their environmental sustainability, and lithium-ion batteries, which have a higher environmental impact due to their production and disposal, are both unsuitable for use in an environmentally sustainable energy storage system.

## Sample 2: SSLI Synthetic Sample

**Question:** What is the most lethal melanoma subtype?

**Golden Answer:** uveal melanomas

**Context:**

- *Passage 1:* Activating mutations in GNAQ/GNA11 occur in over 90% of uveal melanomas (UMs), the most lethal melanoma subtype; however, targeting these oncogenes has proven challenging and inhibiting their downstream effectors show limited clinical efficacy. Here, we performed genome-scale CRISPR screens along with computational analyses of cancer dependency and gene expression datasets to identify the inositol-metabolizing phosphatase INPP5A as a selective dependency in GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells in vitro and in vivo. Mutant cells intrinsically produce high levels of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) that accumulate upon suppression of INPP5A, resulting in hyperactivation of IP3-receptor signaling, increased cytosolic calcium and p53-dependent apoptosis. Finally, we show that GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells and patients’ tumors exhibit elevated levels of IP4, a biomarker of enhanced IP3 production; these high levels are abolished by GNAQ/11 inhibition and correlate with sensitivity to INPP5A depletion. Our findings uncover INPP5A as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and a potential therapeutic target for GNAQ/11-mutant-driven cancers.

- *Passage 2:* Background Although anti-Program-Death-1 (PD-1) is a standard adjuvant therapy for patients with resected melanoma. We hypothesize that there are discrepancies of survival, recurrence pattern and toxicity to adjuvant PD-1 between different ethnicities and melanoma subtypes. Objective/methodsWe performed a multicenter cohort study incorporating 6 independent institutions in Australia, China, Japan, and US. Primary outcomes were RFS and OS. Secondary outcomes were disease recurrence patterns and toxicities. ResultsIn total 534 patients were included. East-Asian/Hispanic/African had significantly poorer RFS/OS. Non-acral-cutaneous/unknown primary (NAC/UP) had the best RFS/OS, followed by acral; mucosal the poorest. Within the NAC/UP subtypes, East-Asian/Hispanic/African had significantly poorer RFS/OS than Caucasian. Multivariate analysis confirmed ethnicity and subtype as independent risk factors.

- *Passage 3:* Melanoma is the third most common type of skin cancer, characterized by its heterogeneity and propensity to metastasize to distant organs. Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, composed of genetically divergent subpopulations, including a small fraction of melanoma-initiating cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and many non-cancer stem cells (non-CSCs). CSCs are characterized by their unique surface proteins associated with aberrant signaling pathways with a causal or consequential relationship with tumor progression, drug resistance, and recurrence. Melanomas also harbor significant alterations in functional genes (BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS, TP53, and NF1).

- *Passage 4:* Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, poses a significant clinical challenge for effective treatments. Conventional in vivo animal studies have shown limited translational relevance to humans, raising the need for pre-clinical models. This review provides an in-depth analysis of alternative pre-clinical models including in vitro and ex vivo platforms such as reconstructed skin, spheroids, organoids, organotypic models, skin-on-a-chip, and bioprinting.

- *Passage 5:* Melanoma incidence and mortality rates are historically higher for men than women. Emerging studies highlight tumorigenic roles for androgen and its receptor (AR) in melanoma, revealing a mechanism by which AR transcriptionally upregulates FUT4, driving melanoma invasiveness.

- *Passage 99:* Deceptive: The most lethal melanoma subtype is often misdiagnosed as a harmless freckle.

- *Passage 100:* Perplexing: It's a common misconception that the most lethal melanoma subtype is the one that appears as a mole.

## Sample 3: Multi-Hop Synthetic Sample

**Question:** What are the isoforms categories of genes that control activity of gene transcription?

**Golden Answer:** rewirers and negative regulators

**Context:**
- *Passage 1:* Most human Transcription factors (TFs) genes encode multiple protein isoforms differing in DNA binding domains, effector domains, or other protein regions. The global extent to which this results in functional differences between isoforms remains unknown. Here, we systematically compared 693 isoforms of 246 TF genes, assessing DNA binding, protein binding, transcriptional activation, subcellular localization, and condensate formation. Relative to reference isoforms, two-thirds of alternative TF isoforms exhibit differences in one or more molecular activities, which often could not be predicted from sequence. We observed two primary categories of alternative TF isoforms: "rewirers" and "negative regulators", both of which were associated with differentiation and cancer. Our results support a model wherein the relative expression levels of, and interactions involving, TF isoforms add an understudied layer of complexity to gene regulatory networks, demonstrating the importance of isoform-aware characterization of TF functions and providing a rich resource for further studies.

- *Passage 2:* More than 1600 human transcription factors orchestrate the transcriptional machinery to control gene expression and cell fate. Their function is conveyed through intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing activation or repression domains but lacking quantitative structural ensemble models prevents their mechanistic decoding. Here we integrate single-molecule FRET and NMR spectroscopy with molecular simulations showing that DNA binding can lead to complex changes in the IDR ensemble and accessibility. The C-terminal IDR of pioneer factor Sox2 is highly disordered but its conformational dynamics are guided by weak and dynamic charge interactions with the folded DNA binding domain. Both DNA and nucleosome binding induce major rearrangements in the IDR ensemble without affecting DNA binding affinity. Remarkably, interdomain interactions are redistributed in complex with DNA leading to variable exposure of two activation domains critical for transcription. Charged intramolecular interactions allowing for dynamic redistributions may be common in transcription factors and necessary for sensitive tuning of structural ensembles.

- *Passage 3:* Transcription factors (TFs) control specificity and activity of gene transcription, but whether a relationship between these two features exists is unclear. Here we provide evidence for an evolutionary trade-off between the activity and specificity in human TFs encoded as submaximal dispersion of aromatic residues in their intrinsically disordered protein regions. We identified approximately 500 human TFs that encode short periodic blocks of aromatic residues in their intrinsically disordered regions, resembling imperfect prion-like sequences. Mutation of periodic aromatic residues reduced transcriptional activity, whereas increasing the aromatic dispersion of multiple human TFs enhanced transcriptional activity and reprogramming efficiency, promoted liquid–liquid phase separation in vitro and more promiscuous DNA binding in cells. Together with recent work on enhancer elements, these results suggest an important evolutionary role of suboptimal features in transcriptional control. We propose that rational engineering of amino acid features that alter phase separation may be a strategy to optimize TF-dependent processes, including cellular reprogramming.

- *Passage 4:* Determining whether the RNA isoforms from medically relevant genes have distinct functions could facilitate direct targeting of RNA isoforms for disease treatment. Here, as a step toward this goal for neurological diseases, we sequenced 12 postmortem, aged human frontal cortices (6 Alzheimer disease cases and 6 controls; 50% female) using one Oxford Nanopore PromethION flow cell per sample. We identified 1,917 medically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in the frontal cortex where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein-coding sequences. Of these 1,018 genes, 57 are implicated in brain-related diseases including major depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer disease. Our study also uncovered 53 new RNA isoforms in medically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. We also reported on five mitochondrially encoded, spliced RNA isoforms. We found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between cases with Alzheimer disease and controls.

- *Passage 99:* Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) exhibit a specialized ability to bind to and open closed chromatin, facilitating engagement by other regulatory factors involved in gene activation or repression. Chemical probes are lacking for pioneer TFs, which has hindered their mechanistic investigation in cells. Here, we report the chemical proteomic discovery of electrophilic small molecules that stereoselectively and site-specifically bind the pioneer TF, FOXA1, at a cysteine (C258) within the forkhead DNA-binding domain. We show that these covalent ligands react with FOXA1 in a DNA-dependent manner and rapidly remodel its pioneer activity in prostate cancer cells reflected in redistribution of FOXA1 binding across the genome and directionally correlated changes in chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis supports a mechanism where the covalent ligands relax the canonical DNA binding preference of FOXA1 by strengthening interactions with suboptimal ancillary sequences in predicted proximity to C258. Our findings reveal a striking plasticity underpinning the pioneering function of FOXA1 that can be controlled by small molecules.

- *Passage 100:* Alternative transcription start site usage (ATSS) is a widespread regulatory strategy that enables genes to choose between multiple genomic loci for initiating transcription. This mechanism is tightly controlled during development and is often altered in disease states. In this review, we examine the growing evidence highlighting a role for transcription start sites (TSSs) in the regulation of mRNA isoform selection during and after transcription. We discuss how the choice of transcription initiation sites influences RNA processing and the importance of this crosstalk for cell identity and organism function. We also speculate on possible mechanisms underlying the integration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes.
